# Colosseum
A card game built with Android Studio as part of our second year module CSC2044 at Queen's University Belfast.

# How to Play
## Start of game
1. Before the game begins, the player chooses both their own hero as well as their opponent’s hero. Both heroes have their own unique abilities.
2. At the beginning of the game decks are shuffled, and a coin is tossed to determine who plays their turn first.
3. Both players then draw their starting hands; if the coin toss came out heads, the player goes first and the enemy gains a bonus mana and a bonus card. Conversely, if the coin toss comes out tails, the enemy goes first, and the player gains the extra mana/card. Finally, it is possible for the coin to land on its edge, in which case the player automatically wins.
4. The game can now commence.

## Win Condition
In order to win the game, the objective is to reduce the opposing player’s health to 0 by any means, through playing and attacking with your minions, abilities and other cards, while also ensuring that your own health stays above 0 to deny victory to your opponent.

## Your turn
1. At the beginning of your turn, you’ll gain one new coin – a denarius.
Your used coins are refilled at the beginning of each turn.
You’ll gain one coin per turn and have a set limit of 10 coins maximum.
Your coins determine which cards you can play during a turn.
2. Draw a card from your deck.
If you have no more cards in your deck at the start of your turn, you will take damage. If this happens again, you’ll take an increased level of damage. This accumulates for every turn you play with no cards.
3. Play your cards 
This depends on how many coins you have during your turn. You may be able to perform many actions (e.g. use a spell card on your opponent’s hero, put down a new spell card, put down a new minion on the game board, etc…) or you may be limited to just one action when your coin count is still low. Each card has a different effect: 
Minions can be played on your side of the game board, although this will cost you coins. A minion must sleep for one turn before they can attack another minion/the opponent’s hero and will be destroyed once their health is fully depleted. It will not cost you any coins to attack with a minion that you have already put down on the board.
Only 8 minions can be in play at one time. If you try to place an 9th on your side of the board it will not work, and you will need to wait until the next one dies. 
Spells are played on the game board, but only exist for the duration of one action.
Weapons are played to the game board. A weapon will add to the hero’s attack value. Weapons last for as long as the weapon durability is above 0, and one durability point is used during each weapon attack. Typically, weapons are used to target minions or the opponent’s hero.
Note: when a minion or weapon is played, it may have a special ability. Refer to the chapter ‘Special Abilities’ in this document for more details.
There will also be an option to surrender the game at this point.
4. End your turn - Now that you’ve carried out your actions for the turn, you should end the turn and allow your opponent to react.
The enemy’s turn lasts for 2 seconds.
